***By BBN Staff:*** The new Cabinet of Belize will be named today and sworn in by Monday according to Prime Minister Johnny Briceno.

The Cabinet of Belize is the executive body to which Her Majesty the Queen through the Governor-General delegates her powers of the state.

Two-thirds of the elected representatives may be named as Ministers, leaving 15 posts to be filled.

In an interview with the media, the Prime Minister said that elected representatives are first and foremost that, and not elected solely to be Minister of the Crown, to use their official title.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the new Ministers will be sworn in in groups of five on Monday.

Afterward, the new Cabinet will meet to discuss key national issues including the COVID-19 pandemic and the flooding situation in western Belize.
