***By BBN Staff:*** The dust has settled from the 2020 General Elections signaling a regime change for the Government of Belize and several constituencies that were once faithful to the United Democratic Party, changing their allegiance. But the Mesopotamia constituency, a UDP stronghold since the 1970s remains intact, with a new face, Shyne Barrow, son of former Prime Minister, Dean Barrow, to lead it.

Barrow, one of only five UDP candidates to become area representatives, takes the reigns from his uncle Michael Finnegan, who held the constituency for the party since 1993.

He won the constituency with 54.79 percent of the votes, a total of 910 beating out the People’s United Party’s Dr. Candice Pitts, who got 751 votes.

Barrow, who was born on Currasow Street, Belize City ran a campaign that emphasized that he is a son of the soil.

At the early age of 8, Barrow had left Belize to live in Brooklyn, New York, and would eventually move on to pursue a career in rap music where he would end up signing a record deal with major record label, Bad Boy, and later a multi-million deal with another major label, Def Jam Records. Barrow would go on to produce three studio albums, one of which from prison while serving a 10-year sentence for a shooting incident at Club New York in 1999. On August 10 2004, Barrow released Godfather Buried Alive album which was number 1 on the R&B Hip Hop Billboard charts and sold a million copies. During his music career, Shyne Barrow also won a Grammy award in 2005 for writing and performing on Usher’s Confessions Album which sold over 20 million copies worldwide. During the course of his music career, Barrow has written and/or performed in various albums that have sold over 40 million copies.

Due to the US policy on foreign parolees, he was deported to Belize in 2009, and in 2010 he was appointed as the country’s Music Ambassador. He would spend the years leading up to the November 11, 2020 elections supporting and organizing music festivals as well as Disc Jockey (DJ) and other music competitions countrywide, and later fostering the development of entrepreneurial activities in the Mesopotamia division.

After winning the Mesopotamia seat in Belize City, Shyne Barrow noted on Instagram that “this victory is for all those who are just like me in Mesopotamia…and the world over! All those who have taken a fall! All those who have stumbled on their life’s journey.”

“We all fall! But to get up and walk, run and rise again is the purpose of life!…my story is testament of human fortitude!…I hope I inspire everyone to overcome their adversities and find their greatness!” Barrow posted.

Breaking Belize News (BBN) wish Shyne Barrow every success as the new area representative for the Mesopotamia division and member of the House of Representatives.
