***By BBN Staff: ***While the United Democratic Party has conceded to losing the 2020 general election, the party has maintained three of its Belize City strongholds: Collet, Mesopotamia, and Queen Square.

Thus far, the only victories recorded for the UDP, these areas have remained faithful to the party for decades. Shyne Barrow, son of outgoing Prime Minister Dean Barrow, and Denise Barrow, his sister, have taken the Mesop’ and Queen Square areas, while UDP Party Leader Patrick Faber has reclaimed Collet.

Faber issued a statement earlier, congratulating People’s United Party Leader John Briceño on his party’s victory in the elections and calling for national unity in the face of the regime change.
