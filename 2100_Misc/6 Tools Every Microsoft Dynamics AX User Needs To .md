.

Just before the start of the annual Microsoft Dynamics AX user group conference (AXUG) I had the opportunity to interview Steve Stallings and Neil Hunter from [Sable37](http://www.erpsoftwareblog.com/flow/post_click.php?bid=1&pid=37762&destination=http%3A//www.sable37.com/). This company offers a suite of innovative add on products to enhance Microsoft Dynamics AX. If you are evaluating Microsoft Dynamics AX or are a current user, here are 6 tools Steve and Neil feel you need to know about.

- **Credit Control & Collections**

Credit Control and Collections is an enhancement to Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009 through 2012 R3 that extends what’s already in the product.  For example, Dynamics AX has a credit limit.  So if you exceeded your credit limit you would be placed on hold.  We add additional flexible features that will let you to do things like allowing clients who haven’t exceeded the credit limit yet but have fallen behind in their payments to be placed on hold.  Also for clients who have a high credit risk due to other factors. We basically build on what’s already there in Dynamics AX and give clients more flexible management for the credit control and the collections business process.

- **Retail+**

In Retail Plus we’re extending the new retail POS including the R3 hand held devices which allow you to have additional flexible reporting at your fingertips. Dynamics AX allows client to sign up in loyalty programs and earn loyalty points. But at the POS at the register, Dynamics AX does not allow clients to take discounts. In many of your grocery chains, if you’re a loyalty member, you immediately get discounts off your sale; so we enhance the loyalty program to add those kinds of capabilities.  Again, we build on the features already in Dynamics AX.

- **Rebates & Royalties**

As for Rebates and Royalties, rebates came out in Dynamics AX 2012 R2.  They were enhanced in Release 3 (R3), but they’re still pretty basic.  We allow you to do royalties on licensed products. For example, if you want to put a Disney logo on apparel but you have to buy Disney royalties in advance, that gets done automatically.  We collect rebates from vendors that are offering rebates and we can pass those on to the customers.  We can also pay rebates to our customers for high volume business.  We can provide all of those, and flexible combinations of those, that are not yet available in Dynamics AX.

- **Product Lifecycle Management**

Product Lifecycle Management simplifies the creation and release of new items within Dynamics AX.  In many companies, especially if they have an engineered product, there are a lot of different departments internally that have to sign off on a new product.   We’ve got workflow that facilitates that process.  It gets the routing and gets the approvals, so people like the engineering department, customer service and cost accounting are all adding the data that they own as part of the item master through the workflow engine.  It goes from stage to stage, gets the data and gets released.  For the apparel industry we also allow you to have specification sheets for your manufacturers and graphics and pictures that you can use for your online catalogs as well. So we brought a lot of things together that were spread around in different parts of Dynamics AX and brought them together for better maintenance and update and put some controls and workflow around that.

- **Import & Landed Costing**

Import and Landed Costing is a must have for anybody who’s importing products, because there are cost elements through multiple legs of a journey that incrementally up the value of a product and it is valued  much higher potentially than what you paid FOB your manufacturer’s side.  So we’re able to keep track of shipments and products that could be mixtures from different purchase orders or even lines of different purchase orders, all coming in on one physical shipment and we can allocate all of the costs that are captured for material handling, duties and customs, and ocean freight and air fright.  You can allocate all of that to the individual products regardless of whether you are using moving average costs or standard costs. We also provide a lot of that same functionality for internal transfer orders.

- **Demand Forecaster**

With Demand Forecaster, we’ve got a series of statistical models, so we can pick a best fit to be based on the sales history and it can be modified based on other events or manual overrides. We can forecast using the best of the 15 models that we have.  We take into account product end of life, supersession, ultimate products, promotions and it’s collaborative so the marketing department, sales department, customer service department can all weigh in on what they believe the best value is for that future forecast.  One of the key outputs is managing forecast error so you can define your optimal inventory levels based on your forecast variability, which is what many companies are trying to get from a forecasting system. We calculate the projected safety stock or the optimal safety stock you should have for that item.  We can bring that back into MRP, so again, a very useful module.

I really like the idea of product life cycle management. Our products tend to go through the life cycle pretty quickly and we introduce new ones on a regular basis. It would be nice to have system that would better keep track of these products and manage their production and sale.
