Sage 100 ERP (formerly branded as Sage ERP MAS 90 and 200) is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software system for small and midsize businesses. The solution is typically recommended to companies with annual revenue between one million and $100 million.

Sage 100 ERP products can be used by a wide range of manufacturing, distribution and services companies, and more granular verticals such as industrial supplies and services, building materials and electronics.

The solution is designed to be compatible with Windows operating systems. Sage 100 Standard ERP was originally built on a Windows platform and is typically deployed on a small Windows network. Sage 100 Advanced and Premium ERP were built to be database-driven, and the premium edition uses Microsoft SQL Server.

The complete solution includes modules for core accounting, distribution, manufacturing, business intelligence, customer relationship management, human resources (HR), time and project management, e-business and new cloud, web and mobile apps designed for remote and field use.

Our employees like the fact that this payroll program allows users to pay them through direct deposit, paycards, or company-generated checks. The variety of pay methods is a plus

This software is reliable and will stand the test of time for your accounting needs. The reports can be hard to read sometimes because of the way it lines up, but you will have the reports you need and easy to find. With Sage 100 you can run accounting for multiple companies, we had 3 at one point. There is some inventory aspects to Sage 100 which we dabbled into briefly but for the restaurant business didn't end up working so great.

Overall Sage 100 is a good program that is user friendly.

##### Pros

Program is easy to use. I literally learned the basics in 2 short days. You can easily tell if a subcontractor or supplier has been paid and retention is very easy to track as well as pay out.

##### Cons

This is not job costing software therefore it will not track contract amounts for you. While you can run detailed reports you will have to run another type of software to get the project management side of things.

Sage should not be used for small or midsize companies.

##### Pros

Every step you do gets recorded. No journal entry can be deleted ever. The system feels safe and accurate.

##### Cons

The report capability, the number of clicks and confirmations you have to go through to complete a simple task

Master programmers and software support is available across the US. If you don't like your support group, you can easily hire another. No need to convert software solutions.

##### Pros

This software is easily customizable at install AND it is reliable. The software updates are rarely a problem; no need to wait for other users to test and work out the bugs found in some software updates.

##### Cons

Module pricing is a little more costly than other software, but then again how much is data integrity worth?

I like to sleep at night, so it's a good investment.

I have used Sage for over 10 years now. I prefer the detail capabilities it offers and love how I can customize it to work for my reports.

##### Pros

Once you understand how Sage works, it is easy to navigate every module. Financial reports can be set up to pull in whatever order or format you need them in. Budget numbers can be added in for easy variance reporting.

##### Cons

Initial training on how to use the software can be a bit overwhelming. I recommend offsite training at a Sage retailer.

##### Pros

Sage ERP is an affordable program for small- to mid-sized companies. It has the potential to perform as an ERP as long as all departments are on board.

##### Cons

Not the most intuitive program and makes customizations difficult. You must purchase the business intelligence add on to customize reports, and that is also not very intuitive. Will require training and existing knowledge of the program.

##### Pros

The software is sophisticated and "open", means you can configure it as your company needs. Using a MS. SQL is the best choice to store and process data accurately.

##### Cons

It requires training to master the software. It is an enterprise ERP application, so, budget consuming as well for Small Medium Business.

We have been using Sage Pro for years. Sales uses it to place orders while accounting keeps records. It is all automated and very fluent.

##### Cons

It has became a bit dated with lack of warehouse management system which is why we are moving to a new program but for smaller business I would highly recommend.

A Sage Business Partner who knows exactly how the company's processes function is the best option for support if multiple add-in modules are used.

##### Pros

Sage 100 Advanced ERP is fully functional for all steps in a wholesale consumer products process. The Reports Explorer allows custom detailed report writing to support general ledger balances. MAS Intelligence reporting uses an Excel BI add-in for financial reporting.

##### Cons

Standard reports require knowledge of Crystal Reports for customizing. Adding multiple third party modules such as Scanforce, Multi-Bin, etc. greatly complicates upgrades to new releases.

Easy to maneuver through it and all the modules. It can do everything I need it to do and it provides me with all of the reports and data that I need.

##### Cons

I get a lot of errors and have to sign out. Things get complicated with multiple users doing certain things at the same time. I think it may be more of a computer issue and not a program issue, but often times I have to wait 10-20 seconds for modules to open which can be frustrating when trying to get things done quickly.

The customer support is the main pro for this software. Most ERP systems rely on online support only, when I have an issue I need to speak to someone immediately and don't have time to wait on a help desk ticket to be created.

##### Cons

There is a little bit of a learning curve when you start with this ERP system. They do offer tutorials to get you started, I'd recommend going through all of them before getting started.
