Panasonic NN-SD372S 0.8-Cubic-Foot Stainless-Steel Inverter Microwave Oven

With its sleek stainless-steel front and silver wrap, this 950-watt microwave oven by Panasonic makes a stylish and convenient addition to any contemporary kitchen. The 0.8-cubic-foot unit with its 11-1/4-inch turntable perfectly cooks and evenly heats anything from breakfast foods and after-school snacks to dinnertime meals and appetizers when entertaining. Ideal for individuals or small families, the compact unit provides quick and easy meal preparation--without taking up excess space on the counter.

Inverter Technology
Moving Beyond Just "Heating Things Up"

Still just using your microwave oven to make popcorn or warm up yesterday's soup? If so, we probably know why. Most microwaves just have one temperature setting--High. Conventional microwave ovens might have a low-power setting, but this is achieved by "pulsing" the high-power setting on and off rather than by emitting a steady stream of low-powered energy.

Cook fresh produce to perfection.

Panasonic's trailblazing Inverter technology delivers true, variable microwave power, which means even temperatures and consistent textures throughout the food being cooked. The consistent delivery of microwave energy allows delicate foods to simmer without the edges and surfaces overcooking, so foods have the look and taste you expect--without the wait.

The Inverter microwave oven takes microwave cooking to a whole new level. You'll experience delicious food that better retains its color, nutrients, and flavor and that's easier and faster to prepare. Oh, and you can still make great popcorn.

Single, Compact Power Supply

Furthermore, the Inverter power unit is smaller and lighter than conventional microwave circuitry (aka the heavy, enclosed side of the microwave), which allows for more interior space to fit that favorite casserole dish, without increasing the oven's overall exterior dimensions. Weighing just 21 pounds, the oven's roomy interior measures 13-7/8 inches long by 12-3/8 inches wide by 8-1/8 high, while its compact exterior measures 15-9/16 inches long by 19-3/16 inches wide by 11 inches high.

Additional Features
Inverter Turbo Defrost

Defrost foods even faster than with the previous Panasonic Auto Defrost. Panasonic Inverter Defrost technology is an advanced microwave sequencing system using the inverter continuous-power delivery feature.

Auto Cook

The oven's one-touch buttons take the guesswork out of cooking by automatically adjusting power levels and calculating cooking times for various food types like pasta, frozen entrees, potatoes, vegetables, and beverages.

Auto Reheat

Reheat one to two servings of precooked room-temperature or refrigerator-temperature foods without setting power and time.

Quick Minute

The one-touch button allows you to automatically set the time in increments of one minute.

Keep Warm Feature

A pulsing delivery of very low microwave power keeps food temperatures at a constant level--without overcooking. So, foods like stew, gravy, and desserts remain warm in the oven for up to 30 minutes after cooking.

Pop-Out Dial

With a spin of the dial, the easy-to-use pop-out dial is a departure from the standard keypad found on most microwave ovens. Use it to set the time and/or weight.

Clock/Timer

Convenient time-of-day clock and count-down timer (up to 1 hour and 30 minutes).

Child-Safety Lock

For safety, the child lock prevents electronic operation (door still opens). Press Start three times to lock ("Child" will be displayed); press Stop/Reset three times to cancel.

Other Highlights

The oven also provides an easy-to-clean interior, 10 power levels, three cooking stages, more/less control, a popcorn button, and delay start.

Push-button controls, pop-out dial, and digital display for easy programming. view larger

Looks great, perfect size to fit our microwave oven opening, heats up food fast. Takes a few tries to get used to not having a keypad and using the dial to set the time but now it's second nature.

broken after 1 year

First time it was broken within 6 months. Got it fixed - changed fuse. No charge because it was within warranty. But still lots of hassle - two weeks no microwave. After one year it was broken again! This time ordered fuse from panasonic parts website - 2$ each. Replaced fuse and it was working again.

If your microwave is broken, don't throw it out yet. Google for "fixing panasonic microwave" for youtube instructions. Likely it is the fuse. Replacing it was very easy but you need a special screw bit to unscrew the frame.

Good product

This has turned out to be a nice little microwave. It looks nice and works well. I missed when I bought it any description stating that it have no number keys. Just a knob to turn to dial in the time. I didn't think I would like it but now its actually easy and quicker than typing in numbers

Great microwave for me

Great microwave for me. It fits nicely above my fridge, the dials and controls are easy to use. It heats food quickly and I like how easy it is to change the power level. As for sound, it doesn't seem to make more noise than the average microwave, at least I haven't found it to be noisey. My only complaint is that the stainless steel shows fingerprints. I keep on having to wipe it down with olive oil, which works, but also makes dust stick to it. I do love the look of stainless steel, I just wish it didn't show fingerprints so badly.
