***By BBN Staff: ***BelAm Production, a US-based organization formed with the intent of displaying the greatest talents of the Caribbean and Central American Countries, is hosting a competition to find the best vocalist from the region.

The Caribbean and Central American Vocal Competition Search is officially underway and will remain open until January 2, 2021. Interested persons need only ensure that they are from countries within the target regions and do not have a recording contract or talent representation.

Selected applicants will go on to compete for a US $5,000 cash prize in the “Battle of the Caribbean & Central American Best Vocalist/Entertainer” competition to be held every Sunday, between February 21st, 2021 to May 2nd, 2021.

Belizean-born Tricia Logan, founder of Belam Production, explained that she envisions the competition as being a positive platform for social interaction among participating countries while promoting their unique cultures.

“What inspired me to come up with this competition was seeing all these talents on American Idol & The Voice and I know that we in the Caribbean and Central American Countries have great talent as well and no one care to do something about it. So I decided it would be a great idea to show what we are made of,” Logan said.

Sign up forms and competition rules can be found at [BelAm Production’s website.](https://www.belamproduction.com/)
