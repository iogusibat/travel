http://traffic.libsyn.com/sedaily/2018_03_14_Web3.mp3Podcast: Play in new window | Download Most applications today run on a cloud provider like AWS. They are built with a framework like Ruby on Rails. They use a set of APIs like Stripe and Twilio for middleware services. This is the era of “web 2.0.” With decentralized systems, we are starting to get a feel for what “web 3.0” might feel like. The futuristic idea of “web 3.0”

http://traffic.libsyn.com/sedaily/2018_03_13_Metamask.mp3Podcast: Play in new window | Download Decentralized applications can be built on the Ethereum blockchain. Just as the Bitcoin blockchain is a distributed, append-only ledger of financial transaction history, Ethereum is a distributed, append-only ledger of computational transaction history. New kinds of applications can be built on the Ethereum blockchain—and just like every new technology, we need an interface to bridge that new technology and our existing technology.  We

http://traffic.libsyn.com/sedaily/2018_03_12_MonopoliesandProofofStake.mp3Podcast: Play in new window | Download Decentralized applications might someday offer alternatives to modern monopolies. Uber, Airbnb, Facebook, Amazon—all of these services could be recreated on a decentralized stack of technologies like Ethereum, IPFS, and Golem. Fully decentralized services could be more transparent, cheaper, and more efficient. But let’s be realistic. Today, even the simplest applications of fully decentralized blockchains don’t work as well as we need them to.

http://traffic.libsyn.com/sedaily/2018_03_09_ProofofStake.mp3Podcast: Play in new window | Download For a decade, Bitcoin’s proof-of-work system has run without disruption. In a proof-of-work scheme, Bitcoin miners compete to solve a cryptographic puzzle associated with a block of transactions. Every ten minutes, all the Bitcoin miner nodes race to be the first to solve a block of transactions. Only one miner wins each block, meaning the other nodes’ time was ultimately wasted. There is

There are lots of group types: religions, corporations, national governments, state governments, citizenries, clubs, musical bands. Every group has governance. Governance defines the rules, and the ways that rules change. The United States requires citizens to pay taxes. A corporation requires you to show up to work, but they have to pay you a salary. Most groups today are

http://traffic.libsyn.com/sedaily/2018_03_07_SmartContracts.mp3Podcast: Play in new window | Download Smart contracts are programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain. A smart contract developer pays Ether to deploy the contract. When a contract is deployed, every full node on the Ethereum blockchain has a copy of the contract code in that node’s address space. Every full node needs to hold a copy of every smart contract. This allows every full node to process

http://traffic.libsyn.com/sedaily/2018_03_05_SmartAgriculture.mp3Podcast: Play in new window | Download Farms have lots of data. A corn farmer needs to monitor the chemical composition of soil. A soybean farmer needs to track crop yield. A chicken farmer needs to count the number of eggs produced. If this data is captured, it can be acted upon—for example, a dry farm can automatically turn up its irrigation system. Or the data can simply be studied.

Jackson Palmer forked Bitcoin and created his cryptocurrency as a play off the “doge” meme. The currency became popular as a means of reddit users “tipping” each other. If I made a comment on reddit that you liked, you might send me some Dogecoin. This use case allowed people to share the idea of Dogecoin

http://traffic.libsyn.com/sedaily/2018_03_01_ScalingBlockchains.mp3Podcast: Play in new window | Download There are two factors that limit the rate at which transactions are accepted into the Bitcoin blockchain: block time and block size. Block time defines how often a new block is appended onto the blockchain. Block size defines how many transactions fit into a new block. As of March 2018, the current block time and block size allow for about 7 transactions per

The contents of the ledger are financial transactions–people sending and receiving Bitcoin currency to each other. Since Bitcoin, there have been other cryptocurrencies that have similar properties–like Ethereum and the IPFS/Filecoin system. Similar to Bitcoin, they use a decentralized, proof of work based system with a currency reward system–but the ledger

For people who don’t use serverless functions, it seems like a niche. Serverless functions are stateless, auto-scaling, event driven blobs of code. You might say “serverless sounds kind of cool, but why don’t I just use a server? It’s a paradigm I’m used to.” Serverless is exciting not because of
