Hi all,

I'm implementing Dynamics GP Fixed Assets module, so I'm doing some tests in a test environment and I'm having some diferences when I calculate Periodic Depreciation Rate and Daily Depreciation Rate for an asset that have a remaining life greater than a year vs an asset than have a remaining life less than a year.  Which means to me that the mathematics is diferent when is the last year of an asset's life.

I would like to have the correct mathematics for both cases.  And also, for the first year of an asset's life.

I'm using Straight Line Depreciation original life depreciation method and Next Period as Averaging Convention.

I'm using GP 10.
Many thanks in advance.
