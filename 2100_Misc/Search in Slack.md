Use search modifiers

Search modifiers help you to narrow your results to specific channels, members, files, and so on. Browse the list of ways to format your search terms to hone in on your search targets.

Channels/DMs
People
Things
Dates/times

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **in:[channel] ** | Searches just the messages and files in a specific channel. |
| **in:@[display name]         ** | Searches your direct messages with a specific member. |
| **to:me** | Searches all direct messages that have been sent to you. |

## **Multiple modifiers**

You can combine modifiers to search for something in a few different places.

Let's say you're looking for a file — it was sent by either Olive or Sally, but you can’t recall who uploaded it. You can search **from:@Olive Gray @Sally Fallon**, then click the **Files** tab to see files uploaded by either person. Here’s what this will look like on your desktop:
