***By BBN Staff:*** Where should you buy property in Belize? Many expatriates make plans to live in Placencia or San Pedro, but others have found a happy home in the Cayo District. They say it’s a hidden gem where they can live affordably and well.

**Easy Living in Cayo**

The Cayo District doesn’t have beaches, but it has sweeping verdant mountain views, jungle rivers, and cascading waterfalls. This pristine region has the best of Belize’s natural beauty along with impressive Maya ruins, nature preserves, and lively villages.

**San Ignacio and Surrounding Communities**

San Ignacio is the capital of the Cayo District. With a population of about 18,000, it is one of the largest destinations in the country. In recent years, it has become a magnet for travelers interested in eco-tourism and wildlife adventures.

Bustling San Ignacio has gourmet restaurants, bars, shops, bank branches, grocery stores, and tour operations. You can book a zip-lining tour, a visit to a Maya ruin, or a cave tubing trip just by strolling through this pleasant town. The weekly farmer’s market is one of the best in Belize.

It’s also close to Spanish Lookout, which is a thriving Mennonite community. The well-tended farms are worth a visit. You can buy honey, nuts, and cheese from the town’s farm stands.

Belize’s capital city is in the Cayo District. Belmopan is about an hour’s drive from San Ignacio. You’ll find government offices, international bank branches, a local airstrip, and other amenities in Belmopan.

**You Can Still Find Deals in Cayo**

Unlike Belize’s more popular destinations, the Cayo District remains an affordable place to buy property and live. In recent years, the local real estate market has seen consistent growth. Expatriates and retirees from around the world have built thriving communities of people who enjoy the simple life in Belize.

**Visit Carmelita Gardens**

Carmelita Gardens is a self-sufficient, off-grid community on the banks of the scenic Belize River. It’s a place where community gardens, respect for the environment, artisanal businesses, and slow living are all celebrated.
